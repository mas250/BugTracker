<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a Bug or Issue Tracker Wesbite developed by Matthew Shaw for Sparta Global. 
    Having a portal to keep track of issues as they arise during a project offers many benefits. 
    The advantage of having this as a separate program is that it allows teams to collaborate on problems as a 
    developer on another project may have previously found a solution to a current problem. 
    This project will be developed in an agile manner with incremental releases.
